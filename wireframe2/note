- won't have time to play since guys are here.
- reminder of the week's holidays ending very soon.
- feel like going to my room and crying.
- feel like my holiday is not long enough.
- feel like my alone time is being infringed upon by others.
- feel like i need some time to myself.

a les day.
go out to the movies.
go out and get a massage.
go out to the art gallery.

do something that you enjoy:
- game-making. you enjoy this, and it's something you can do that doesn't require 
  just yourself being in the lounge.
- electronics planning.
- making your game catalogue.

i need time to myself.
cromwell will be an excellent refresher.
unfortunately my timing wasn't ideal - as there is a two week gap between being back at work (albeit in a very laid-back state), and going to cromwell.
however, this does allow me to get back into my groove nicely.

a general sense of unease based on fact of guys being around at any given time.
general unease since andrew is also in town, waiting contact.

my ideal situation:
another weeks leave
time to play wipeout and other games.

my current situation:
enjoy the time you have. you're only 2.5 days into another 4.5 days of leave. that's a lot of time off.

go out and walk along the beach.
go out to the warehouse again and have a look at their game selection.
have some cider this evening.

enjoy the beatiful food you have available.

let the pigs have fun.
